**Define CSS:**

Cascading STyle Sheets

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and  describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It was developed by W3, the World WIde Web Consortium.

**Benefits of working with CSS:**

1. Using cascading style sheets generally leads to less code behind your web pages which helps the downoad times of a page.
2. CSS allows for more control over the presentation of your web pages.
3. The basic idea behind CSS is to separate the structure of a document from the presentation of the document making it easier to separate the styling from the structure.

**HTML and CSS are good since:**

1. HTML and CSS are good  because HTML is used to structure the webpage whereas CSS is used to style the webpage and they both work seamlessly together.
2. Being able to build websites or having
   an understanding of how these languages are utilized can help you build
   optimized, user-friendly websites and without the basics you’ll struggle
   for better results.
3. As fundamental web development languages HTML and CSS are a great way to get started with development and are both easy to learn.
